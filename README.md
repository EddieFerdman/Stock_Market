**Goal12: Backtesting models and strategies**

**Scripts Overview:**

2. **Target2 Base Classifiers** - Using indicators created in FeatureEngineering script and a number of stocks, train various classifier and compare results. No tuning is done at this point.
3. **Backtesting** - This is another type of performance metric and is a bit of fun. Using any model already created, back test the outcome for any stocks and time period using a set number of trading days, stop loss and stop win amounts.


**Pipeline:**
